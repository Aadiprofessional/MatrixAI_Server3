# Image Processing Update

## Migration from Jimp to Sharp

This project has been updated to use the Sharp library for image processing instead of Jimp. This change was made to resolve issues with the Jimp library's resize and quality methods.

### Changes Made

1. Removed Jimp dependency from package.json
2. Added Sharp dependency
3. Updated image processing code in videoRoutes.js to use Sharp instead of Jimp

### Benefits of Sharp

- Faster performance (Sharp is typically 4-5x faster than Jimp)
- More reliable API
- Better maintained library
- More features for image processing
- Simpler API for common operations

### Example Usage

Previous code with Jimp:
```javascript
import * as Jimp from 'jimp';

// Image processing
const image = await Jimp.Jimp.read(Buffer.from(imageBuffer));
const processedBuffer = await image
  .resize({ w: 1024, h: Jimp.Jimp.AUTO })
  .quality(85)
  .getBufferAsync(Jimp.Jimp.MIME_JPEG);
```

New code with Sharp:
```javascript
import sharp from 'sharp';

// Image processing
const processedBuffer = await sharp(Buffer.from(imageBuffer))
  .resize(1024)
  .jpeg({ quality: 85 })
  .toBuffer();
```

### Testing

The Sharp implementation has been tested and confirmed to work correctly. The test script `test-sharp.js` demonstrates the proper usage of Sharp for image processing.
