# PCI-DSS Compliance Analysis for MatrixAI Airwallex Payment System

## Executive Summary

This document analyzes the current MatrixAI payment system's PCI-DSS compliance requirements based on the Airwallex integration and provides a roadmap for achieving full compliance.

## Current Payment System Architecture

### Integration Type
- **Payment Provider**: Airwallex
- **Integration Method**: API-based payment intent creation with hosted payment pages
- **Current Implementation**: Server-side payment intent creation, client-side payment processing

### Data Flow Analysis
1. **Payment Intent Creation**: Server creates payment intent via Airwallex API
2. **Client Secret Delivery**: Server returns client_secret to frontend
3. **Payment Processing**: Frontend redirects to Airwallex hosted payment page
4. **Payment Completion**: Airwallex handles card data collection and processing
5. **Status Verification**: Server queries payment status via API

### Cardholder Data Handling
- ✅ **No card data storage** in our database
- ✅ **No card data transmission** through our servers
- ✅ **No card data logging** in our application logs
- ✅ **Hosted payment page** handles all sensitive data

## PCI-DSS Compliance Level Determination

### Transaction Volume Assessment
Based on the Airwallex PCI-DSS documentation:

- **Level 1**: >6 million transactions annually
- **Level 2**: 1-6 million transactions annually  
- **Level 3**: 20,000-1 million e-commerce transactions annually
- **Level 4**: <20,000 e-commerce transactions annually

**Current Assessment**: Most likely **Level 4** (assuming <20,000 transactions annually for a growing platform)

### Applicable Compliance Requirements

For **Hosted Payments Page integration** at Level 4:
- **Required**: SAQ A questionnaire
- **Renewal**: According to specific policy (typically annual)
- **Additional Requirements**: None for Level 4

## Current Compliance Status

### ✅ Compliant Areas
1. **No Cardholder Data Storage**: System doesn't store any card data
2. **Secure Transmission**: All payment data goes directly to Airwallex
3. **Hosted Payment Processing**: Using Airwallex hosted payment pages
4. **API Security**: Using proper authentication and HTTPS

### ⚠️ Areas Requiring Attention
1. **Formal SAQ A Documentation**: Not yet completed
2. **Compliance Monitoring**: No formal process in place
3. **Annual Renewal Process**: Not established
4. **Security Logging**: Payment logs need PCI-DSS compliance review

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Documentation and Formal Compliance (High Priority)
1. Complete SAQ A questionnaire
2. Submit Attestation of Compliance (AOC) form
3. Establish annual renewal process

### Phase 2: Enhanced Security Measures (Medium Priority)
1. Review and enhance payment logging practices
2. Implement compliance monitoring
3. Add security headers and validation

### Phase 3: Ongoing Compliance (Low Priority)
1. Update API documentation
2. Create compliance testing procedures
3. Establish compliance reporting

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Current architecture is inherently PCI-DSS compliant
- No cardholder data exposure
- Using certified payment processor (Airwallex)

### Medium Risk
- Lack of formal documentation
- No compliance monitoring process

### Mitigation Strategy
- Complete formal compliance documentation immediately
- Establish regular compliance reviews
- Maintain current secure architecture

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Action**: Complete SAQ A questionnaire and AOC form
2. **Architecture**: Maintain current hosted payment page approach
3. **Monitoring**: Implement annual compliance review process
4. **Documentation**: Keep compliance certificates current

## Conclusion

The current MatrixAI payment system architecture is well-positioned for PCI-DSS compliance. The use of Airwallex hosted payment pages means we fall under the SAQ A category, which has minimal compliance requirements. The primary need is formal documentation and establishing ongoing compliance processes.
